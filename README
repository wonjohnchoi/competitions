New Rule (2015-01-20): to keep track of list of problems solved (by myself and with solution),
I set a rule so that each leaf directory contains a text file named SUMMARY.
The file categories each file name on the directory to one of SOLVED_BY_MYSELF, UNDERSTOOD_WITH_SOLUTION, ATTEMPTED files.
For example, a summary file looks like this
====
SOLVED_BY_MYSELF
A.java
B.java
E.cpp
UNDERSTOOD_WITH_SOLUTION
C.py
D.java
ATTEMPTED
F.java
