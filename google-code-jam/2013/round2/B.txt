Problem



We're going to run a tournament with 2N teams, and give out P identical prizes to the teams with ranks 0..P-1.



The teams are numbered 0 through 2N-1. When team i and team j play against each other in a game, team i will win iff i<j.



The teams for a tournament are organized in some order, called the tournament's tournament list, which contains all 2N teams in the tournament. The tournament list will affect which teams play each other, and in what order.



Your job will be to find the largest-numbered team that is guaranteed to win a prize, independent of how the tournament list is ordered; and to find the largest-numbered team that could win a prize, depending on how the tournament list is ordered.



Tournament Resolution



The tournament is conducted in N rounds.



Each team has a record: the list of the results of the games it has played so far. For example, if a team has played three games, and won the first, lost the second and won the third, its record is [W, L, W]. If a team has played zero games, its record is [].



In each round, every team plays a game against a team with the same record. The first team in the tournament list with a particular record will play against the second team with that record; the third team with the same record will play against the fourth; and so on.



After N rounds, each team has a different record. The teams are ranked in reverse lexicographical order of their records; so [W, W, W] > [W, W, L] > [W, L, W] ... > [L, L, L].



Here is an example of a tournament with N=3, and the tournament list [2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 1, 0], where the columns represent different rounds, and the teams are grouped by their records. The winner of each game in the example has been marked with a *.
