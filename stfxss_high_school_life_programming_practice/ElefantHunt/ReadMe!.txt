*ElefantHunt 1.0.0 code distribution

Explanation about the software:
* ElefantHunt is a board game created long time ago. But, by us (ElefantHunt team), it is given a new life
  as a turn based graphical computer game. It is still in the process of developing and we are planning to 
  make final version in a year. 
  
How to play:
* If you are programmer, run TestElefantHunt.java using JVM
* 

Programmings & Designers:
* See 'Organizing Document for ElefantHunt Project.doc'
* The document includes what each person performed a in the team.

Known Issues:
* Some recursive methods can cause StackOverFlow Except (ex)onPlayersTurn, onPort)
  But some other recursive methods like onFireHunters will be completely safe
* GUI is incomplete; it does not have powerful integration
* This game is not tested fully - only tested by 3 people for 4 days - so you may find errors 
  If you find any error while playing, please contact 1-647-427-1924
  Or you may access to our homepage (www.elefanthunt.com) to report error 
  Our homepage will open at July 1st
* MessageBox is not always located at the top (You should manually move it to top if you can't see)
* See 'ElefantHunt Debug.doc' document to see what errors have existed and fixed.
